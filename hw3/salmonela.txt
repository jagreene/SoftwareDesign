Upon doing a blast search on a pseudo-random subset of the amino acid sequences I found that they were all related to different strains of salmonela. Many were associated with the synthisis of ATP, and antigen presentation. Many were even tagged with the key phrase "associated with virulence". This leads me to believe that thes are in fact virulence causing protiens from salmonela. I would also like to take this time to thank Abe Levithan, he was incredibly useful in helping
me debug, as well as showing me more pythonic methods of achieving my goals. While all of the code was implemented by myself it would be far less condense and elegant if it wasn't for Abe's advice.
